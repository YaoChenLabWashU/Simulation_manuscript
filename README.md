These are the codes for simulation pipeline: Fluorescence Lifetime Simulation for Biological Applications (FLiSimBA) from manuscript 'Beyond conventional wisdom: unveiling quantitative insights in fluorescence lifetime imaging via realistic simulation of biological systems.

Functions: functions used in the pipeline
          GenPop512_FLIM_v2: generation of exponential decay population
          FlIMsim512_v2: sampling a number of photons from the exponential decay population and convolve based on the instrument response function (IRF)
          AutoFluo_sim_v2: sampleing of photons based on a empirically determined photon distribution; this function could be used for simulation of empirically determined autofluorescence or background
